## Top 3 Issues to Fix Now

### 1. Generic Class Names (DashboardLayout.vue)
**What's Wrong:**
```html
<div class="group_2">
<div class="group_4">
<div class="group_5">
<div class="section_1">
```

**What To Do:**
```html
<div class="dashboard-wrapper">
<div class="dashboard-panels">
<div class="dashboard-map-area">
<div class="dashboard-map-container">
```

**File:** `/src/components/DashboardLayout.vue`  
**Time:** ~1 hour  
**Difficulty:** Easy

---

### 2. Dual Image Import Methods
**What's Wrong:**

Component uses local object:
```javascript
const images = { rankingPanelBg: '/images/...' }
<div :style="{ backgroundImage: `url(${images.rankingPanelBg})` }">
```

**What To Do:**

Use centralized mixin:
```javascript
import imageMixin from '@/mixins/imageMixin'
<div :style="getBackgroundImageStyle(getImagePath('RIGHT_PANEL', 'RANKING_BG'))">
```

**File:** `/src/components/RightRankingPanel.vue`  
**Time:** ~2 hours  
**Difficulty:** Medium

---

### 3. CSS Duplication
**What's Wrong:**

Utilities defined twice:
```less
/* In global.less */
.flex-row { display: flex; flex-direction: row; }

/* Also in LeftDataPanel.vue scoped styles */
.flex-row { display: flex; flex-direction: row; }
```

**What To Do:**

Remove from component scoped styles, use global.less

**File:** `/src/components/LeftDataPanel.vue` (line 537)  
**Time:** ~30 minutes  
**Difficulty:** Easy

## Key Takeaways

### Good Patterns (Keep Using)
✓ CSS custom properties (--color-primary, --space-4, etc)  
✓ Mixin-based styling (.flex-row(), .card(), etc)  
✓ Utility-first approach (global.less)  
✓ Component mixins for cross-cutting concerns  
✓ Slot-based layout composition  

### Bad Patterns (Stop Using)
✗ Generic class names (group_2, section_1)  
✗ Local image objects (const images = {...})  
✗ Mixed approaches for same task  
✗ Hardcoded image paths  
✗ Empty CSS blocks  

### New Standards
→ Use BEM pattern for components (.block--modifier__element)  
→ Use imageManager + imageMixin for all images  
→ Use state modifiers (.is-active, .has-error)  
→ Add ARIA attributes to interactive elements  
→ Document naming conventions in components
